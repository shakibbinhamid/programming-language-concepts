# programming-language-concepts
This is my coursework from the module COMP2212 in Year 2 Software Engineering in University of Southampton

This is a simple interpreter for a Domain Specific Language specialised for set theory related problems for example: union, kleene star etc. However, it is extended to solve Integer problems like 'primality test' etc.

It supports - 

1. Integer, Boolean and String manipulation.
2. Conditionals (short and long 'if') and Loop (both 'for' and 'for each' loop)
3. A Set data structure of Strings that supports 'add' and 'remove' of elements
4. Printing of results (primitive and sets).

Please have a look!
